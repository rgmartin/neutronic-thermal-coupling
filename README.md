## Coupling between  neutronic code CITVAP and thermal code RELAP for a nuclear reactor

[Final report](https://github.com/rgmartin/neutronic-thermal-coupling/blob/main/Tesis%20Acople%20Rubert.pdf)

A coupling method between neutronic code CITVAP and thermal code RELAP is developed for stationary states of the core of a nuclear reactor. Programs relap2citvap
y citvap2relap are developed to allow for the information flow between the two codes. The proper functioning of the coupling is validated against experimental data from Australian reactor OPAL. In particular the feedback coefficient is computed, and compared against the measured experimental value. A good agreement between the numerical and experimental values is observed.
